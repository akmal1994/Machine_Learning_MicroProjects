### Introduction
In this repository I am showing all my project whatever I solved during my post graduation, self-learning (from Kaggle). All the dataset I am using is for determination and easily available in kaggle and other resources. I assure that datasets used here is non-confidencial all are for trainig purpose and practicing to make proper approach towards data science.

### Motivation
I am from Mechanical Background as I have completed my bachelor of technology (B.Tech), post that I worked in core mechanical based industries. The work is based on a set of rules and there was nothing innovative to contribute. I lost my interest after working 2 years and decided to make a career change but I was not sure where should I go which path to follow.Eventually, I got an opportunity to work in a Trading company that recently began its research operations. I used to work with data and it was quite interesting to analyze data and cull out decision-making insights. I discussed the future prospects of the current work with my colleague and he suggested to me data science.  From there on I took over a year to understand the basics of data science. I got enrolled in Analytics and Artificial Intelligence programme from Imarticus Institute. I found it relatively easier to grasp the content and the materials owing to my experience in programming during my college days.

### Project Description

#### Machine Learning
   1. [**Unsupervised Learning (Credit Card):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/ML-Unsupervised-Learning/Bank-Clustering.ipynb) Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customer's credit card details of tenure, credit_limit,     minimum_payment, purchase for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
   2. [**Supervised Learning (Bank Marketing):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/ML-Supervised-Learning/Bank_Marketing_Classification.ipynb) Applying different supervised model and measure performance of every model on bank marketing dataset to predict more accuratly whether the customer will stay with bank or not.
   3. [**Deep Learning (Pizza Quality Classification):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Pizza_Classification_CNN%20(DL).ipynb) Build Convolutional Neural Network for pizza company and pass the dataset to our network for learning about good_pizza and burnt_pizza, so that it learn and predict on new image of pizza whether good or burnt.
   4. [**Deep Learning (Brain Tumor Classification):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Brain-Tumor-Classification.ipynb) Health care problem is major concern of this century. This work is just an approach on how AI can be use full to detecting the type of Desied not only for brain but many more. This project is based to brain MRI scan to predict the type of tumor so that the patient get an early treatment and with the help of these technology Life expectancy of patient can be improved.

Libraries and Frameworks: *Tensorflow2, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*
