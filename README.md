### Introduction
In this repository I am showing all my project whatever I solved during my post graduation, self-learning (from Kaggle). All the dataset I am using is for determination and easily available in kaggle and other resources. I assure that datasets used here is non-confidencial all are for trainig purpose and practicing to make proper approach towards data science.

### Motivation
I am from Mechanical Background as I have completed my bachelor of technology (B.Tech), post that I worked in core mechanical based industries. The work is based on a set of rules and there was nothing innovative to contribute. I lost my interest after working 2 years and decided to make a career change but I was not sure where should I go which path to follow.Eventually, I got an opportunity to work in a Trading company that recently began its research operations. I used to work with data and it was quite interesting to analyze data and cull out decision-making insights. I discussed the future prospects of the current work with my colleague and he suggested to me data science.  From there on I took over a year to understand the basics of data science. I got enrolled in Analytics and Artificial Intelligence programme from Imarticus Institute. I found it relatively easier to grasp the content and the materials owing to my experience in programming during my college days.

### Dataset

  ***Machine Learning***
  - Bank Credit Card **(Unsupervised)**
  - Portugal Bank Marketing **(Supervised)**
  - Crop Status **(Supervised & Imbalanced)**
  - Sales Estimate **(Supervised & Regression)**

### Project Description

#### Machine Learning
   1. [**Unsupervised Learning (Credit Card):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/ML-Unsupervised-Learning/Bank-Clustering.ipynb) Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customer's credit card details of tenure, credit_limit,     minimum_payment, purchase for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
   2. [**Supervised Learning (Bank Marketing):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/ML-Supervised-Learning/Bank_Marketing_Classification.ipynb) Applying different supervised model and measure performance of every model on bank marketing dataset to predict more accuratly whether the customer will stay with bank or not.
