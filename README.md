### Introduction
In this repository I am showing all my project whatever I solved during my post graduation, self-learning (from Kaggle). All the dataset I am using is for determination and easily available in kaggle and other resources. I assure that datasets used here is non-confidencial all are for trainig purpose and practicing to make proper approach towards data science.

### Motivation
I am from Mechanical Background as I have completed my bachelor of technology (B.Tech), post that I worked in core mechanical based industries. The work is based on a set of rules and there was nothing innovative to contribute. I lost my interest after working 2 years and decided to make a career change but I was not sure where should I go which path to follow.Eventually, I got an opportunity to work in a Trading company that recently began its research operations. I used to work with data and it was quite interesting to analyze data and cull out decision-making insights. I discussed the future prospects of the current work with my colleague and he suggested to me data science.  From there on I took over a year to understand the basics of data science. I got enrolled in Analytics and Artificial Intelligence programme from Imarticus Institute. I found it relatively easier to grasp the content and the materials owing to my experience in programming during my college days.

### Project Description

#### Machine Learning
   1. [**Unsupervised Learning (Credit Card):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/ML-Unsupervised-Learning/Bank-Clustering.ipynb) Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customer's credit card details of tenure, credit_limit,     minimum_payment, purchase for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
   2. [**Supervised Learning (Bank Marketing):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/ML-Supervised-Learning/Bank_Marketing_Classification.ipynb) Applying different supervised model and measure performance of every model on bank marketing dataset to predict more accuratly whether the customer will stay with bank or not.
   3. [**Supervised Learning (Crop Status):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/ML-Supervised-Learning/Crop_Status.ipynb) Analyzing the data of agriculture / crop and build a model to predict the status of it on various parameters as mentioned on file.
   4. [**Sales Prediction:**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/ML-Supervised-Learning/Sales%20Prediction%20(Regression).ipynb) Regression based probles of book stall, where we need to predict/forecast the sales based on genres on the given day of a week.

#### Deep Learning
   1. [**Deep Learning (Pizza Quality Classification):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Pizza_Classification_CNN%20(DL).ipynb) Build Convolutional Neural Network for pizza company and pass the dataset to our network for learning about good_pizza and burnt_pizza, so that it learn and predict on new image of pizza whether good or burnt.
   2. [**Deep Learning (Brain Tumor Classification):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Brain-Tumor-Classification.ipynb) Health care problem is major concern of this century. This work is just an approach on how AI can be use full to detecting the type of tumor not only for brain but many more. This project is based to brain MRI scan to predict the type of tumor so that the patient gets an early treatment and with the help of these technology Life expectancy of patient can be improved.
   3. [**Deep Learning (ANN on MNIST with MLP):**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning%20(MNIST%20with%20MLP).ipynb) In this project simple Artificial Neural Network is used and uses MNIST dataset to train our model. This is academy project. Simple architecture about ANN.
  4. [**Dream House Prediction:**](https://github.com/akmal1994/Machine_Learning_MicroProjects/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Dream_House_Prediction.ipynb)
  **Goal:** Goal of this project is to build a simple classification model which will classify captured images into a house image or a non-house image. Our model can help with the automatic check such that the user will be restricted from adding any non-house image, only images relevant to the house will get uploaded to the website.
  
  - **Data Description:** Data is in the form of images collected from multiple sources.
    
  - **Training Data:** Train set is divided into house and non-house categories. While training the model we can label images with house as 1 and non-house as 0.
  - **Test Data:** Test set contains images of both house and non-house data.
  - **Evaluation Criteria:** The evaluation metrics for this problem statement is the accuracy score where each image label is matched with the actual label.
